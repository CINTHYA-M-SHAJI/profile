                <hr>

                                <p> I am a self taught programmer. My hobby was tinkering with linux.
                                    Thereby i always had a problem with linux. Those problems where the reason of who i am.
                                    The thing with linux users are they never stop tinkering.
                                    When you more attach with that you wil get more problems and you have to solve the problems.
                                    So i have to find the solutions and made it perfectly. </p>
